# UX Improvements Summary

## Changes Made - October 21, 2025

### 1. Removed Excessive Scroll Animations ✅

**Problem:** Too many "scroll to explore" indicators with bouncing animations were distracting and unnecessary.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Removed scroll indicator from `Hero.tsx`
- ✅ Removed scroll indicator from `Header.tsx`
- ✅ Cleaner, more professional look without repetitive animations

**Files Updated:**
- `src/app/components/Hero.tsx`
- `src/app/components/Header.tsx`

---

### 2. Human-Readable Time Format ✅

**Problem:** Times displayed in 24-hour format (13:00:00, 14:00:00) are hard to read.

**Solution:**
- ✅ Created `formatTime()` helper function
- ✅ Converts 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM
- ✅ Removes unnecessary seconds
- ✅ Applied to all time displays

**Examples:**
- `13:00:00` → `1:00 PM`
- `14:30:00` → `2:30 PM`
- `09:00:00` → `9:00 AM`
- `18:45:00` → `6:45 PM`

**Files Updated:**
- `src/app/components/Schedule.tsx` - Guest-facing schedule display
- `src/app/components/WeddingDetailsManager.tsx` - Admin time display

## Before vs After

### Before:
```
❌ Multiple bouncing scroll indicators on every section
❌ Times showing as "13:00:00" and "18:00:00"
❌ Repetitive animations causing distraction
```

### After:
```
✅ Clean, minimal design without excessive animations
✅ Times showing as "1:00 PM" and "6:00 PM"
✅ Better focus on actual content
✅ More professional appearance
```

## Technical Details

### Time Formatting Function
```typescript
const formatTime = (time: string): string => {
  if (!time) return '';
  
  // Remove seconds if present (e.g., "13:00:00" -> "13:00")
  const timeParts = time.split(':');
  if (timeParts.length < 2) return time;
  
  let hours = parseInt(timeParts[0]);
  const minutes = timeParts[1];
  
  // Determine AM/PM
  const period = hours >= 12 ? 'PM' : 'AM';
  
  // Convert to 12-hour format
  hours = hours % 12 || 12; // Convert 0 to 12 for midnight
  
  return `${hours}:${minutes} ${period}`;
};
```
