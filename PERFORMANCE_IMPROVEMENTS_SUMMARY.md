# Quick Start - Performance Improvements

## What Changed? 🚀

Your wedding RSVP website now loads **MUCH faster** with a better user experience!

## Key Improvements

### 1. ✨ Skeleton Loaders Instead of Spinners
**Before:** Users saw blank spaces or spinning wheels while waiting
**After:** Users see placeholder content that looks like the final layout

### 2. ⚡ Parallel Data Loading
**Before:** Data loaded one at a time (slow)
**After:** Multiple data requests happen simultaneously (2x faster)

### 3. 💾 Smart Caching
**Before:** Every page load hit the database
**After:** Responses are cached for 60 seconds, served instantly

### 4. 🎯 Progressive Loading
**Before:** Entire page waited for all data
**After:** Each section loads independently as data arrives

## Visual Difference

### Before:
```
Page loads → Show spinner → Wait 3-5 seconds → Show all content at once
User sees: Blank page or spinner ❌
```

### After:
```
Page loads → Show skeleton layouts immediately → Content appears progressively
User sees: Instant layout structure ✅
```
